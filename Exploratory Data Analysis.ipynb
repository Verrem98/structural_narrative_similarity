    "\n",
    "**As an example, you could show data, label, or group balances, skewness, and basic characterizations of the data. Information about data frequency and distributions as well as results from reduction mechanisms such as PCA could be useful. Furthermore, indicate outliers and how/why you are taking them out of your samples, if you do so.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The idea is, that you conduct this analysis to a) understand the data better but b) also to verify the shapes of the distributions and whether they meet the assumptions of the methods that you will attempt to use. Finally, make good use of images, diagrams, and tables to showcase what information you have extracted from your data.**\n",
